Ask outscale for:
- do they use guest agent
- What would be a realistic I/O load?
- frequency of snapshots
- frequency of streams, waht is streamed i.e. which snapshots to keep and
  which to flatten

Experiments:
- how does the guest I/O performance evolve with the number of snapshots
- what impact the snapshot time?
  - guest workload since the last snapshot
  - speed of the storage?
  - number of past snapshots?
- what impact streaming time?
  - number of snapshots, content of snapshots
  - speed of the storage
